        Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu: محمد علی جناح mʊɦəmːəd̪ əli d͡ʒɪnɑː(; born
        Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a
        barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the
        leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of
        Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first
        governor-general until his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
        Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled
        at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics,
        which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence
        in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th
        century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated
        Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the
        Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also
        become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule
        League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to
        safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In
        1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
        follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent
        should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status
        they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the
        Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a
        separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the
        League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned,
        and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most
        of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the
        Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow
        the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following
        independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence
        of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of
        Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish
        the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of
        Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan
        after the two states' independence, personally supervising the
        establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948,
        just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United
        Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable
        streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah.
        Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's
        name. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and
        Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a
        national holiday in Pakistan. According to his biographer, Stanley
        Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.
      </p>
      <h2>Family and childhood:</h2>
      <p>
        Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, and he likely
        was born in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a
        rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi, now
        in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British
        India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti village in
        Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India). He was of a
        Gujarati Khoja Nizari Isma'ili Shi’a Muslim background, though Jinnah
        later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings. After his death, his
        relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later
        life to the Sunni sect of Islam. His sectarian affiliation at the time
        of his death was disputed in multiple court cases. Jinnah was from a
        wealthy merchant background. His father was a merchant and was born to a
        family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state
        of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village.
        They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their
        departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of
        the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe
        for shipping than Bombay. Jinnah was the second child; he had three
        brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah.
        The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to
        speak Kutchi, a dialect of Sindhi widely spoken in Karachi, and English.
        Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he
        was more fluent in English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his
        siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he
        advanced in his legal and political careers. He has sometimes been
        referred to as a Muhajir by some writers because of his Gujarati
        ethnicity. However, the use of the term "Muhajir", meaning "immigrant",
        in reference to his early life, is considered anachronistic by others as
        this term came into use after the partition in 1947, referring to Muslim
        refugees who migrated to Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have
        attended the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at
        the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the
        Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High
        School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high
        school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large
        number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were
        circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court,
        listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow
        of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official
        biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving
        boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah
        discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them
        to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket
        instead.
