        Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu: محمد علی جناح mʊɦəmːəd̪ əli d͡ʒɪnɑː(; born
        Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a
        barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the
        leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of
        Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first
        governor-general until his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
        Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled
        at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics,
        which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence
        in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th
        century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated
        Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the
        Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also
        become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule
        League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to
        safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In
        1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
        follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent
        should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status
        they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the
        Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a
        separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the
        League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned,
        and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most
        of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the
        Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow
        the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following
        independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence
        of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of
        Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish
        the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of
        Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan
        after the two states' independence, personally supervising the
        establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948,
        just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United
        Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable
        streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah.
        Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's
        name. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and
        Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a
        national holiday in Pakistan. According to his biographer, Stanley
        Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dissatisfied with the law, Jinnah briefly embarked on a stage career
        with a Shakespearean company, but resigned after receiving a stern
        letter from his father. In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest
        British Indian to be called to the bar in England Although he returned
        to Karachi, he remained there only a short time before moving to Bombay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mohammad Ali Jinnah December 25, 1876 – September 11, 1948) was a 20th
        century lawyer, politician, statesman and the founder of Pakistan. He is
        popularly and officially known in Pakistan as Quaid-e-Azam (“Great
        Leader”) and Baba-e-Qaum (“Father of the Nation”).
      </p>
      <p>
        After his death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had
        converted in later life to the Sunni sect of Islam. His sectarian
        affiliation at the time of his death was disputed in multiple court
        cases. Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant background.
      </p>
      <h2>Family and childhood:</h2>
      <p>
        Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai, and he likely
        was born in 1876, to Jinnahbhai Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a
        rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi, now
        in Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British
        India. Jinnah's paternal grandfather was from Paneli Moti village in
        Gondal state in Kathiawar peninsula (now in Gujarat, India). He was of a
        Gujarati Khoja Nizari Isma'ili Shi’a Muslim background, though Jinnah
        later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings. After his death, his
        relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later
        life to the Sunni sect of Islam. His sectarian affiliation at the time
        of his death was disputed in multiple court cases. Jinnah was from a
        wealthy merchant background. His father was a merchant and was born to a
        family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in the princely state
        of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village.
        They had moved to Karachi in 1875, having married before their
        departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of
        the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe
        for shipping than Bombay. Jinnah was the second child; he had three
        brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister Fatima Jinnah.
        The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to
        speak Kutchi, a dialect of Sindhi widely spoken in Karachi, and English.
        Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he
        was more fluent in English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his
        siblings, where they settled or if they met with their brother as he
        advanced in his legal and political careers. He has sometimes been
        referred to as a Muhajir by some writers because of his Gujarati
        ethnicity. However, the use of the term "Muhajir", meaning "immigrant",
        in reference to his early life, is considered anachronistic by others as
        this term came into use after the partition in 1947, referring to Muslim
        refugees who migrated to Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have
        attended the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at
        the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the
        Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High
        School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high
        school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large
        number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were
        circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court,
        listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow
        of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official
        biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving
        boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah
        discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them
        to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket
        instead.
      </p>
      <h2>Education in England:</h2>
      <p>
        In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate of Jinnahbhai
        Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London apprenticeship with his firm,
        Graham's Shipping and Trading Company. He accepted the position despite
        the opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an
        arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his junior from the
        ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and first
        wife both died during his absence in England. Although the
        apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity for Jinnah,
        one reason for sending him overseas was a legal proceeding against his
        father, which placed the family's property at risk of being sequestered
        by the court. In 1893, the Jinnahbhai family moved to Bombay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soon after his arrival in London, Jinnah gave up the business
        apprenticeship in order to study law, enraging his father, who had,
        before his departure, given him enough money to live for three years.
        The aspiring barrister joined Lincoln's Inn, later stating that the
        reason he chose Lincoln's over the other Inns of Court was that over the
        main entrance to Lincoln's Inn were the names of the world's great
        lawgivers, including Muhammad. Jinnah's biographer Stanley Wolpert notes
        that there is no such inscription, but inside (covering the wall at one
        end of New Hall, also called the Great Hall, which is where students,
        Bar and Bench lunch and dine) is a mural showing Muhammad and other
        lawgivers, and speculates that Jinnah may have edited the story in his
        own mind to avoid mentioning a pictorial depiction which would be
        offensive to many Muslims. Jinnah's legal education followed the
        pupillage (legal apprenticeship) system, which had been in force there
        for centuries. To gain knowledge of the law, he followed an established
        barrister and learned from what he did, as well as from studying
        lawbooks. During this period, he shortened his name to Muhammad Ali
        Jinnah.
      </p>
      <p>
        During his student years in England, Jinnah was influenced by
        19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian
        independence leaders. His main intellectual references were peoples like
        Bentham, Mill, Spencer, and Comte. This political education included
        exposure to the idea of the democratic nation, and progressive politics.
        He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders
        Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first
        British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before
        Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury
        Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of
        Commons from the visitor's gallery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Western world not only inspired Jinnah in his political life, but
        also greatly influenced his personal preferences, particularly when it
        came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing,
        and throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public. His
        suits were designed by Savile Row tailor Henry Poole & Co. He came to
        own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with
        detachable collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the
        same silk tie twice. Even when he was dying, he insisted on being
        formally dressed, "I will not travel in my pyjamas." In his later years
        he was usually seen wearing a Karakul hat which subsequently came to be
        known as the "Jinnah cap".
      </p>
      <p>
        Jinnah served as leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 till
        Pakistan’s independence on August 14, 1947 and Pakistan’s first
        Governor-General from August 15, 1947 till his death on September 11,
        1948. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress
        initially expounding ideas of Hindu-Muslim unity and helping shape the
        1916 Luck now Pact between the Muslim League and the Indian National
        Congress; he also became a key leader in the All India Home Rule League.
        He proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the
        political rights of Muslims in a self-governing India.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jinnah later advocated the Two-Nation Theory embracing the goal of
        creating a separate Muslim state as per the Lahore Resolution. The
        League won most reserved Muslim seats in the elections of 1946. After
        the British and Congress backed out of the Cabinet Mission Plan Jinnah
        called for a Direct Action Day to achieve the formation of Pakistan. The
        direct action by the Muslim League and its Volunteer Corps, resulted in
        massive rioting in Calcutta between Muslims and Hindus/Sikhs. As the
        Indian National Congress and Muslim League failed to reach a power
        sharing formula for united India, it prompted both the parties and the
        British to agree to independence of Pakistan and India. As the first
        Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah led efforts to lay the foundations
        of the new state of Pakistan, frame national policies and rehabilitate
        millions of Muslim refugees who had migrated from India.

        There are many few Personalities in this world that helps their nation
        to achieve their goals. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah is one of the
        great personality of the Pakistan and The Muslims of the Subcontinents
        who change the life of the Muslims in Subcontinents and Make a Separate
        homeland for them. He is also known as the Baba-e-Qaum (The Father of
        the Nation).
