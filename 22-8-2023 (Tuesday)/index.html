        Muhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu: محمد علی جناح [mʊɦəmːəd̪ əli d͡ʒɪnɑː(ɦ)]; born
        Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a
        barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the
        leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of
        Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first
        governor-general until his death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
        Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled
        at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics,
        which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence
        in the Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th
        century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated
        Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the
        Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also
        become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule
        League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to
        safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In
        1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to
        follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent
        should have their own state to avoid the possible marginalised status
        they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the
        Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a
        separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the
        League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned,
        and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most
        of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the
        Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow
        the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following
        independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the independence
        of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of
        Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish
        the new nation's government and policies, and to aid the millions of
        Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan
        after the two states' independence, personally supervising the
        establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September 1948,
        just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United
        Kingdom. He left a deep and respected legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable
        streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah.
        Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's
        name. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and
        Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a
        national holiday in Pakistan. According to his biographer, Stanley
        Wolpert, Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.
